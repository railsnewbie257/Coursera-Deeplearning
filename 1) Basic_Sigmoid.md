What you need to remember:

- np.exp(x) works for any np.array x and applies the exponential function to every coordinate
- the sigmoid function and its gradient
- image2vector is commonly used in deep learning
- np.reshape is widely used. In the future, you'll see that keeping your matrix/vector dimensions straight will go toward eliminating a lot of bugs.
- numpy has efficient built-in functions
- broadcasting is extremely useful
